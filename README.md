# Music Prediction Using Decision Tree

A decision tree is a machine learning algorithm that can be used to classify items into different categories. In this project, I use a decision tree to classify music into different genres based on the age and gender of the listener.

To do this, we would first need to gather a large dataset of music listeners and their corresponding age and gender information. We would also need to label each piece of music with its corresponding genre.

This project could be useful for music streaming platforms or music recommendation systems, as it would allow them to provide more personalized recommendations to users based on their age and gender. It could also be used by music marketers to target specific demographics with their advertising campaigns.
